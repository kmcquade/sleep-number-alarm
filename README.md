# sleep-number-alarm

This script will raise the Sleep Number bed to the "Watch TV" position.

Ideally, this would be run as an Alexa Skill using a Lambda function so I could ask Alexa to make me sit up every morning - but I haven't learned how to create custom Alexa skills yet and I am not at that level with Golang yet. So for right now, I'm using the Jenkins server hosted on my Raspberry Pi to run it at 7:30am Monday through Friday. I'll edit the time in Jenkins until I can write this Alexa skill.
